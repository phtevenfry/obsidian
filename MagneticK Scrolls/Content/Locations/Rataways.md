### High Concept

As you begin your descent in the [[DelvCap]] system, your first stop into the [[EggTown]] is the rataways, a dank network of converted sewers and tunnels that have been claimed by the [[Erratans]] and [[Talparians]] as their preferred residence. However, it is often visited by those who wish to participate in less than legal activities. to the chagrin of many of the area's natives, no doubt. 

## Considerations

- First of all people live here. If you go around kicking down doors willy nilly, there's high chance you'll find yourself spelunking in someone's home. Even the most hospitable of Erratans would find this quite irksome. 
- Secondly, because the local constables tend to turn a blind eye to this less than lawful gray space, some residents have resorted to bespoke defense systems (booty traps). Despite your good intentions it's best to watch your step.

**Traps** #traps
*snaptrap*: loot on human-sized mouse trap
	- easy to spot
	- 2 dex saves: 1 for looting without activation, 2 to dodge if activated
*overwhelming snaps*
	- floor covered with set mouse traps, stepping stone or balance beam path
	- added "fun" 
		- pressure plate that activates hopper of steel bearings that can set off a chain reaction
		- or a normal rat enters while party is in the middle and seems interested in the bait
